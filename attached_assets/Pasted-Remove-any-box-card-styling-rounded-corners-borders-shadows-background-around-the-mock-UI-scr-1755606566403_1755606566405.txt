Remove any “box/card” styling (rounded corners, borders, shadows, background) around the mock UI screenshots.

Make the screenshots render crisp and slightly smaller (because assets are 4× from Figma) while staying responsive.

File to edit: UC1Page component (the file shown above).

Changes

In the three “Feature” sections that show the screenshots
(containerUc1Image, containerUc1SecondImage, containerUc1ThirdImage), update the wrapper <div> and <img> so there is no rounded radius, no box shadow, no border, no background.
Replace each wrapper + image with this exact structure:

<div className="relative flex justify-center items-center h-full px-0 py-6">
  <img
    src={containerUc1Image} // (or containerUc1SecondImage / containerUc1ThirdImage)
    alt="Mock UI"
    className="block w-[640px] md:w-[760px] lg:w-[880px] max-w-full h-auto select-none pointer-events-none object-contain"
    style={{
      // scale down a bit because assets are exported @4x
      transform: 'scale(0.92)',
      transformOrigin: 'center',
      imageRendering: 'auto', // keep it smooth
      filter: 'none'
    }}
  />
</div>


Remove from those three <img> tags (and their wrappers) any of the following if present:

rounded-*, shadow-*, border, bg-*, backdrop-*, drop-shadow*

Custom inline shadows like filter: 'drop-shadow(...)'

Ensure the first hero video keeps its current scale, but for consistency, update its inline styles to use the same pattern (object-fit and no borders):

<video
  src={heroVideo}
  autoPlay
  loop
  muted
  playsInline
  className="w-full h-auto max-w-lg block object-contain"
  style={{ transform: 'scale(1.1)', transformOrigin: 'center' }}
/>


Do not re-introduce any card-like container around these media blocks. The goal is that the screenshots look like flat, edge-to-edge UI mocks with no box around them.

Keep all other sections unchanged.

Acceptance

The three feature screenshots render with no rounded corners, no shadow, no border, no tinted background.

They are slightly smaller than the raw 4× asset (about 92% scale) and responsive (w-[640–880px] across breakpoints).

No visual “box” remains around the mock UI cards.
