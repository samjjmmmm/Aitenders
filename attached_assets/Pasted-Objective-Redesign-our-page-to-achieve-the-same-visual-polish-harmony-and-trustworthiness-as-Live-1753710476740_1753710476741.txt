Objective:
Redesign our page to achieve the same visual polish, harmony, and trustworthiness as Livestorm, while strictly keeping our original wireframe and all existing content.
1. Whitespace & Layout Clarity

    Generously increase outer spacing between major sections and internal padding within cards/blocks (32–48px on desktop, 20–32px on mobile).

    Avoid crowding: Let each content block “breathe” and stand apart; no elements should touch container edges.

    Align all content to a consistent grid with broad gutters for balance and predictability.

2. Card & Section Presentation

    Every card or section must:

        Have soft, multi-layered drop shadows (subtle and neutral, not harsh),

        Large rounded corners (20px+),

        A gentle background: faded gradient or softly patterned (no solid, saturated color fills),

        Centered or evenly offset within the page for focus.

3. Typography & Scale

    Use a contemporary sans-serif font (Inter, IBM Plex, etc.), applied consistently.

    Establish a clear visual hierarchy:

        Extra-large, bold headlines

        Well-spaced, mid-size subheader text

        All body copy at least 18px, 1.4 line-height

    Keep accent colors for headlines or CTAs only; all other text is dark on very light backgrounds for maximum clarity.

4. Iconography

    Replace any generic or placeholder icons with a single, consistent professional set (e.g., Feather, Heroicons, Material, Font Awesome Pro).

    Use icons thoughtfully: one per feature/benefit/point, left-aligned, uniform size and color.

    Make every icon visually meaningful, never decorative only.

5. CTA & Button Enhancement

    Make primary action buttons stand out:

        Large, bold, with brand accent background and white text,

        Smooth border-radius, ample padding (min 18x48px),

        Subtle elevation or color shift on hover/focus,

        Only one primary CTA per major section.

    Place the CTA with space around it, not crowded against text or list items.

6. Visual Depth & Realism

    Incorporate gentle gradients, faded overlays, or background patterns—always subtle and layered for dimensionality.

    All visuals (UI mosaics, illustrations, images) must be crisp, embedded in context (e.g., device/browser frame if you show a product UI), not as flat screenshots or boxes.

7. Trust & Social Proof

    If allowed by wireframe, below main CTAs add a strip/logos of trusted brands, client testimonials, or key user numbers—rendered in tasteful grayscale or brand-muted color, never harsh or overpowering.

8. Responsiveness & Accessibility

    On mobile, all sections/cards stack vertically with preserved whitespace; font and icon sizes do not shrink below recommended minimums.

    All interactive elements (buttons, cards) should be accessible via keyboard and screen reader (aria-labels, alt text, minimum 4.5:1 color contrast).

9. General Style Rules

    No flat color blocks, no excessive borders.

    Never hard-align elements to screen edges.

    Rely on depth, shadow, padding, and harmonious color transitions for separation.

    All visuals, text, and UI must feel balanced, modern, and aspirational—not like a presentation slide.

Example Instruction Summary

    “Apply Livestorm-level polish: maximize and balance whitespace throughout the layout; use modern card and section styling with rounded corners and soft shadows; apply a premium, uniform icon set; ensure headlines and CTAs are bold, visually prominent, and spaced apart; layer backgrounds with gentle gradients/fades; and provide a responsive experience that’s just as beautiful and usable on mobile. Don’t change any of our actual wireframe or content blocks—only the visual style, spacing, and interactive feedback.”
