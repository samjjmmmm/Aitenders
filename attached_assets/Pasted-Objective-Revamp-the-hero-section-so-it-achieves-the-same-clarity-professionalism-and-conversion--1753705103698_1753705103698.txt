Objective:
Revamp the hero section so it achieves the same clarity, professionalism, and conversion impact as the Livestorm example. Emphasize whitespace, concise value messaging, a dominant and realistic UI visualization, and a clear, action-oriented CTA with trust elements.

Requirements:

    Visual Hierarchy & Whitespace

        Add ample whitespace between headline, subtext, stats, and CTA.

        Ensure no crowding—each element should have breathing room and clear separation.

        Use a modern SaaS-friendly color palette (soft backgrounds, minimal bold accents).

    Copywriting & Content

        Condense subtext for readability. Prefer short, pointed sentences or bulleted mini-lists.

        Limit statistics to the most impactful (one or two max), presented subtly.

        Only include a single, primary CTA above the fold (“Watch Demo” or “Request Demo”).

        Move any secondary links (like “Download Use Case”) to a less prominent position or use outlined style.

    UI Visual/Mockup

        Replace the abstract UI card with a high-quality screenshot or realistic mockup of your actual product in use (dashboard, organized RFP process, team collaboration).

        Add contextual cues: avatars, notification pop-ups, or a visual that tells the product’s story, not just abstract shapes.

        Image should be sharply rendered and accessible (alt text).

    CTA and Trust Elements

        Design a large, visually-dominant primary CTA button. Use brand accent color and maintain high contrast.

        Position the CTA right below value statements, not on the same line as secondary CTAs.

        Add social proof below the CTA (e.g., star rating, customer logo strip, or “Trusted by 1,000+ teams”).

    Design Consistency

        Use one accent color across the hero for highlights and CTA, not for statistics or unnecessary accents.

        Standardize font sizes, weights, and button treatments.

        Ensure iconography (if used) matches product style and is not generic.

    Accessibility & Responsiveness

        Minimum 4.5:1 contrast for all interactive elements and text.

        All important buttons and visuals keyboard navigable, with aria-labels/alt text.

        On mobile: elements stack logically with spacing preserved, text remains easy to read.

Implementation Note:
Refer to the structure and polish in the Livestorm image—headline, simple subtext, realistic product UI, large CTA, trust logos—when designing and coding every element.
