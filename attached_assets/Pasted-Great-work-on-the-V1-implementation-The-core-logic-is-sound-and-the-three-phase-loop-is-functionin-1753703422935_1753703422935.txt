Great work on the V1 implementation. The core logic is sound, and the three-phase loop is functioning as requested. It successfully tells the basic story.

Now, let's focus on polish and "game feel." Our goal is to make this feel less like a sequence of states and more like a single, fluid transformation. The user should feel the magic of the process, not just observe it.
What's Working Well:

    Core Concept: The three-phase story (Analyze -> Collaborate -> Risk Manage) is clear.

    Layout: The card structure, fonts, and CTA placement are solid and match the spec.

    Clarity: The text overlays are effective and timed correctly with each phase.

Areas for Polish & Refinement:

    Overall Aesthetics & "Juice":

        Color Palette: The current palette is a bit muted. The reference video uses a more vibrant purple/indigo gradient for the primary CTA and brighter, more distinct colors for the avatars (cyan, magenta, green). Let's inject more of that brand energy.

        Shadows & Depth: The shadow on the main card is a bit harsh. Let's soften it to a shadow-2xl and maybe add a very subtle inner shadow or gradient to the animation area to give it more depth.

        Floating Elements: The reference video includes two floating "lozenge" elements: ✅ AI Analysis Complete and ✏️ Ready for Review. These add context and dynamism. We should incorporate them.

    Phase 1: "Smart Start" Animation:

        The "Transformation" is Missing: Currently, the messy documents just fade out, and the clean matrix fades in. The prompt specified a transformation. We need to make this more literal and satisfying. The feeling of "chaos to order" is the key emotional beat here.

        Suggestion: Instead of static cards, let's have 3-4 document outlines fly in from off-screen in a scattered, chaotic way. They should tumble and overlap. Then, they should animate to converge at the center, flattening and shrinking into a single point before expanding out as the clean, structured matrix. This directly visualizes "From 500+ pages... instantly."

    Phase 2: "Seamless Collaboration" Animation:

        Static Appearances: The avatars and checkmarks currently just "pop" into existence. This feels abrupt.

        Suggestion (Avatars): Have the avatars animate in from the edges of the animation area, perhaps with a slight overshoot and bounce (a "spring" animation). This makes it feel like team members are actively "joining" the workspace.

        Suggestion (Checkmarks): Instead of fading in, let's have the checkmarks draw themselves on the screen using an SVG path animation. This is a very common and satisfying micro-interaction that reinforces the idea of "validating" or "completing" a task.

    Phase 3: "Risk Control" Animation:

        Visual Disconnect: The current animation shows the row turning red, but the ShieldAlert icon appears in the text overlay at the bottom. The user's eye has to jump between the problem (in the matrix) and the icon (below it).

        The "Resolution" is Missing: The key promise is that the system detects & fixes the change. We show the detection (red alert) but not the fix (green resolution).

        Suggestion: Let's contain the entire action within the matrix itself.

            A specific row flashes red.

            A red AlertTriangle icon appears inside that row and pulses gently.

            After a brief moment, the icon fluidly morphs into a green CheckCircle.

            Simultaneously, the row's background animates from red to green.

            Then, the text overlay "Every change detected..." fades in at the bottom, explaining the action the user just witnessed.

New Prompt for Replit Agent

Here is the revised, detailed prompt to generate the polished V2.

Task: Rebuild the animated UI card with a focus on fluid, meaningful micro-interactions and a more vibrant aesthetic. Do not change the core three-phase concept, but enhance the execution based on the following detailed specifications.

Global Aesthetic Changes:

    Container: Use a soft, large shadow (shadow-2xl). The main animation area should have a very subtle background gradient like bg-slate-50.

    Colors:

        CTA Button: Use a vibrant gradient: bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-indigo-600.

        Avatars: Use brighter, distinct background colors: bg-cyan-400, bg-fuchsia-400, bg-emerald-400.

        Icons: Use a more vibrant purple for the bottom icons: text-purple-600.

Animation Concept – 3 Phases (Refined)

Phase 1 (0s–3s): "Smart Start" - The Transformation

    Visual:

        Start with a blank animation area.

        A cascade of 3-4 messy, rotated document outlines (simple divs with borders) fly in from the top-left corner and scatter in the center. Use a stagger effect.

        After ~1.5s, these outlines quickly animate towards the center, merging and morphing into the clean, structured compliance matrix which then scales up to its final size. This transition should be fast and smooth.

    Text overlay: “From 500+ pages to a structured compliance base — instantly.”

    Icon: FileText

Phase 2 (3s–5s): "Seamless Collaboration" - The Activity

    Visual:

        The structured matrix is now stable.

        Three user avatars (with initials) animate in from the edges of the card, settling into their positions around the matrix with a gentle spring-like bounce. Use framer-motion's spring transition.

        Sequentially, from top to bottom, a green checkmark is drawn on each row using an SVG path animation (pathLength property in Framer Motion).

    Text overlay: “Experts collaborate in real‑time — without Excel chaos.”

    Icon: Users

Phase 3 (5s–8s): "Risk Control" - The Resolution

    Visual:

        The avatars and checkmarks fade out.

        The third row of the matrix flashes red (bg-red-100).

        A red AlertTriangle icon appears inside the row and pulses 1-2 times.

        After ~1s, the AlertTriangle icon fluidly morphs into a green CheckCircle icon (use AnimatePresence with mode="popLayout" or a similar technique).

        Simultaneously, the row's background smoothly animates from bg-red-100 to bg-green-100.

    Text overlay: “Every change detected, every risk managed.”

    Icon: ShieldAlert

Additional Floating UI Elements (Animate throughout the loop):

    "AI Analysis Complete" Lozenge:

        A green lozenge (bg-green-100 text-green-700) with a checkmark.

        It should animate in from the top (fading and sliding down) at the very beginning of the loop (at 0s) and stay visible for the entire duration.

    "Ready for Review" Lozenge:

        A light blue lozenge (bg-blue-100 text-blue-700) with a pencil icon.

        It should float in from the bottom right near the end of the loop (around 7s) with a gentle, floating motion, hinting at the next step for the user. It fades out as the loop restarts.

Tech Stack:

    React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React.

    Pay close attention to using AnimatePresence, variants for staggered animations, spring transitions, and SVG pathLength animation for the checkmarks.

    The entire component should be self-contained in a single file for easy integration.
