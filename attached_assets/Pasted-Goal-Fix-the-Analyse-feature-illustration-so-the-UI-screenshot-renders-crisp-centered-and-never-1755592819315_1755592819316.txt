Goal: Fix the “Analyse” feature illustration so the UI screenshot renders crisp, centered, and never overlaps/clips content at any breakpoint.

Context/Symptoms:

In ProductPage, the “Analyse” block uses:

className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-contain"

style={{ transform: "scale(1.8)", transformOrigin: "center center", maxWidth: "none", maxHeight: "none" }}

wrapped by a relative aspect-square container.

This combination causes overflow/clipping on desktop and awkward scaling on smaller viewports.

What to change (acceptance criteria):

Remove any forced scaling (transform: scale(...)) and absolute positioning of the image.

Replace the aspect-square box with a responsive container that constrains max width/height and lets the image size naturally (object-contain).

Ensure the image is centered, has rounded corners and a soft shadow, and never exceeds the container (no cropping).

Add loading="lazy" and decoding="async", and a proper sizes attribute for responsiveness.

On mobile/tablet, the image should shrink to fit the column with no horizontal scroll.

On large screens, cap height around 520–560px to avoid dominating the layout.

Keep decorative background effects from overlapping the image (use z-10 on the figure and overflow-visible in the grid item if needed).

Test breakpoints: 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px.

Deliverables:

Refactor the JSX for the “Analyse” image block as below (or equivalent).

No other visual regressions.

Drop-in fix (replace only the image block inside the “Analyse” section)
{/* RIGHT COLUMN — Analyse screenshot (fixed) */}
<div className="flex justify-center items-center relative">
  <figure
    className="
      feature-illustration
      relative z-10 w-full max-w-2xl
      mx-auto
      rounded-2xl
      shadow-2xl
      border border-slate-200/60
      bg-white
      overflow-hidden
    "
    style={{ maxHeight: 560 }}
  >
    <img
      src={analyseUIImage}
      alt="Aitenders — interface d’analyse"
      className="block w-full h-auto object-contain"
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
      sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 560px, (min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw"
    />
  </figure>
</div>


And remove this old wrapper and styles from your code:

{/* OLD (remove) */}
<div className="w-full max-w-lg relative z-10">
  <div className="relative aspect-square">
    <img
      src={analyseUIImage}
      className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-contain"
      style={{
        transform: "scale(1.8)",
        transformOrigin: "center center",
        maxWidth: "none",
        maxHeight: "none"
      }}
    />
  </div>
</div>


Optional (tiny helper CSS):

<style>{`
  .feature-illustration img { display:block; }
  @media (max-width: 1024px) {
    .feature-illustration { max-height: 520px; }
  }
`}</style>
