Objective:
Redesign our pain point section with a large feature card, inspired by top SaaS (Livestorm), focusing on premium whitespace, clear hierarchy, and emotional clarity.

Implementation Specs:

    Section/Card Structure

        Center a single, large card/container on the page with a subtle multi-tone or gradient faded background.

        “Float” the card with a soft drop shadow and generous outside margin.

        Rounded corners; high max-width (900–1000px); 36–48px internal padding.

    Content Hierarchy—Inside the Card

        Headline (H1): Short, bold, top of card, centered or left for balance on desktop, always extra large.

        Subtext: Place below headline, lighter color, max 2 lines, 18–20px, clear scan-ability.

        CTA: Big, bold button directly beneath subtext, high-contrast accent color, sticky hover/focus effect, width auto.

    Feature Listing Pattern

        Each pain point or solution as its own mini-feature:

            Start with a meaningful icon (select from Material, Heroicons, or Feather—never placeholders).

            Mini-Heading (H2): Clear, concise, action-oriented (limit to 5–7 words).

            1–2 line description: What’s the customer win?

        Stack features vertically, at least 32px spacing between each.

    Visual Style & Extras

        Use a pale, brand-accented faded pattern or gradient in card background (not a flat fill).

        Add mild effects: slight animation fade-in, button micro-interactions.

        Card shadow should be neutral and never harsh.

        Use a consistent icon color and sizing next to all feature headings.

    Trust & Social Proof

        Add a trusted-by logo array, metric (e.g., “Over 2,000+ teams trust us”), or client badge section just below the CTA or at the card’s base.

    Mobile/Accessibility

        Stack H1, subtext, CTA, then each feature, with full width on mobile, padding at least 24px.

        All icons and buttons must have aria-labels or alt text.

        Fonts minimum 18px, button at least 44px tall, no crowding.

    Do NOT Use:

        Flat one-color blocks or harsh separations.

        Dense/fine-print paragraphs or generic iconography.

        Slides or PowerPoint-like grouping—think web-native, not document-based.

</section>

Summary for Dev/Designer:

    “Rebuild our pain point section as a large, visually floating card with modern faded backgrounds and clear chunked typography. Use concise, bold headlines; split each point into its own visually distinct feature row with pro icons; make CTA dominant; and add social proof. The result must feel premium, web-native, and instantly trustworthy—no more PowerPoint-style density.”
