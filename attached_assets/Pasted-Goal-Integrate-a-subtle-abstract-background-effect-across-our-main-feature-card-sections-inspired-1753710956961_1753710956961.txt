Goal:
Integrate a subtle, abstract background effect across our main feature/card sections, inspired by Livestorm’s modern SaaS style. The effect must never distract from the core content, but should lend depth, polish, and visual interest using our brand colors.
Design Requirements

    Placement & Prominence

        The abstract background must be layered behind the main card/feature section, not touch or overlay text or content blocks.

        It should remain a tangible presence—visible around, not behind, the main card edges—but always secondary to the content.

        No part of the accent should reduce legibility or compete with content.

    Style & Composition

        Use a soft, flowing composition: consider gradients, gentle waves, curves, blobs, or geometric forms.

        Incorporate transparency, blurring, or blending so the effect is “felt” rather than seen directly.

        Layer multiple shapes for depth: e.g., a large faded gradient blob, plus smaller, semi-transparent accents.

        Avoid heavy, solid shapes or busy patterns.

        The design must feel ultra-modern and “airy” (not static, blocky, or noisy).

    Color Usage

        Main colors for gradients or large shapes:

            #F5F9FE (bleu pâle)

            #EBF2FD (bleu pastel)

            #C3D9F8 (bleu clair)

        Accent or inner gradient stops (sparingly, for depth or direction):

            #3880E8 (bleu primaire)

            #FBFCFF (bleu blanc, for light highlights)

        Never use #112646 (bleu foncé) or #0B1A2E (noir) in the background accent—reserve these for text/CTA/focus.

        Use opacity and blur to keep everything light and non-distracting.

    Responsiveness

        Ensure the background adjusts and scales smoothly across screen sizes, remaining visible but unobtrusive on mobile.

        On smaller screens, simplify or fade out some shapes for space.

    Implementation Guidance

        Use CSS gradients and/or blurred SVG shapes layered with absolute or fixed positioning behind the main card container.

        If using SVG, use filter: blur() to increase atmospheric effect.

        Never allow background layers to overlap main content area or CTA.

    Accessibility

        Maintain full contrast for all interactive elements and text over the accent.

        Test that color and pattern never interfere with reading or selection, even for users with vision challenges.

Example Implementation Concept (for the Developer)

    “Layer a large, subtle background ‘atmosphere’ of overlapping, blurred, semi-transparent blobs and gentle gradients. Place them behind the card, shifting from pale blue pastel at the top-left (e.g., #F5F9FE, #EBF2FD) through to a faint blue primary (#3880E8) as a directional accent. Use no more than 10% accent opacity in any spot. On mobile, reduce the number and density of shapes. All main content must sit in front of this background on a white or ultra-light card for full clarity.”

Summary Line for Your Agent:
“Add a non-distracting, layered abstract background in soft blue gradients and pale accents, always behind the main content, as seen in world-class SaaS like Livestorm. Keep it subtle, scalable, never interfering with readability—a touch of high-end flair, not a backdrop.”

This approach will instantly raise your page’s perceived value and visual credibility while respecting your brand identity and user focus.
