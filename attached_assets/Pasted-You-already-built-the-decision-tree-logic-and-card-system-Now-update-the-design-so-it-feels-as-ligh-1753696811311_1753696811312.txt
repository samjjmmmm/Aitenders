You already built the decision-tree logic and card system.
Now update the design so it feels as light and professional as a Figma mockup, with a modern, human‑centric look.
Style Guidelines

    Overall Layout

        Use plenty of whitespace for a breathable design.

        Center the content with a max-width container (max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6).

        Background: light neutral gradient (from-gray-50 to-white) instead of flat blue.

    Typography

        Headline: text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900

        Subtext: text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-3

        Step indicator: small, subtle, text-sm text-gray-500.

    Cards

        Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)

        Soft shadow (shadow-sm hover:shadow-md)

        Hover effect: slight lift + accent border (hover:border-blue-500)

        Card text: text-base font-medium text-gray-800

        Icons: minimal outline icons (Lucide/Heroicons), muted accent colors (green, blue, orange, purple).

    Colors

        Stick to one primary accent (blue) + secondary highlights (green, orange, purple).

        Avoid heavy, full‑blue fills.

        Use soft neutral backgrounds (bg-white, bg-gray-50) for cards.

    Progress Indicator

        Small step counter above cards: “Step 1 of 5”.

        Optional: subtle progress bar (h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-full with an accent fill for progress).

    Animations

        Smooth hover transitions (transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out).

        Slight card scale on hover (hover:scale-105).

        CTA button: pulse or subtle shadow on hover.

    CTA

        At the final step, button design:

    bg-blue-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-xl 
    font-semibold shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700
    transition-all

    Position centered, with top margin for breathing space.

Placeholder UC Pages

    Each /uc1–/uc8 page should match this clean style:

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-50 text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900">Coming Soon</h1>
          <p className="mt-3 text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-md">
            This Use Case page is under construction. Check back soon.
          </p>
        </div>

Key Goal

The page should feel light, minimal, modern, and human‑friendly — closer to a Figma professional design than a raw developer prototype.
Avoid heavy icons, blocky blue fills, or dense layouts.
