Objective:
Redesign our current pain point section to match the quality and layout of the Livestorm card-style feature section. After the hero, create a large, visually appealing card with a subtle/faded background effect. Arrange headline, subtext, and CTA at the top inside this card, then list key pain point features as concise H2s with supporting bodies below.
Implementation Instructions

    Section Layout

        Place a single, large “card” container centered in the viewport, with generous padding and a subtle faded/gradient background effect (like Livestorm's).

        The card must feel spacious, modern, and framed in white or very light neutral, casting a soft shadow.

        On desktop: The card is centered with max-width (e.g., 800–1000px), with 32–48px padding inside.

        On mobile: The card becomes full-width with slightly less padding but retains all content structure.

    Content Structure (Top of Card)

        H1: Place the main headline at the top, bold, with extra large font size.

            Text: Master complex bids before they master you

        Subtext: Add a supporting paragraph immediately under the H1 in a muted or secondary color, 18–20px, limited to ~2 lines on desktop.

            Text: Complex multi-lot RFPs are a compliance nightmare for expert teams because manual Excel tracking creates dangerous gaps that cost million-euro opportunities. With AItenders, you receive:

        CTA Button: Place a large, high-contrast CTA button directly under the subtext, centered or left-aligned for balance.

            Text: Watch a 2-Minute Demo

            Add hover and focus states.

    Visual Design (Background Fade)

        Give the card a subtle background fade, gradient, or patterned overlay inspired by Livestorm. Avoid heavy solid color blocks—use a pale accent or gentle swirl.

        If possible, add a faint drop shadow or elevate the card with soft edges.

    Pain Point Feature Listing (Below Hero Content in Card)

        For each major pain point/benefit, create a mini-section within the card:

            H2 (Feature Heading): Bold, concise, and action-oriented (e.g., “Automatic Project Organization”).

            Body Paragraph: 1–2 lines describing the impact/value, written clearly and with a customer benefit outcome.

        Present features vertically (not as a dense grid or bullets):

            Add space between each for scan-ability.

            Optionally, include a relevant icon left of each H2 to visually cue the theme.

        Use proper HTML structure: <h2>, <p>, <button>, etc.

    Additional Interaction & Accessibility

        Everything should be keyboard navigable; all icons must have aria-label or alt text.

        Minimal animation: Fade in the card, subtle hover/press on buttons.

        Maintain at least 4.5:1 color contrast on all text and interactive elements.

    Responsiveness

        On small screens, stack all elements vertically in this order: H1 → Subtext → CTA → Each pain point (H2 + body).

        Generous vertical spacing to aid readability/touch targets.

Summary for Replit Developer

    Large center card after hero with faded background design (not harsh color block).

    H1, subtext, and CTA at the top, visually prominent—mirroring the inviting structure of Livestorm’s example.

    List each core pain point as a mini-section inside the card, with H2 title and succinct description, optional icon.

    Prioritize whitespace, font hierarchy, and touch-friendly spacing.

    All styling, interaction, and HTML structure must follow best practices in accessibility and B2B SaaS standards.
