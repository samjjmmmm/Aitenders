    “I am preparing a bid or proposal to submit.”

    “I am managing a project that is already in execution.”

    “I need support to draft documents and prove compliance.”

    “I am exploring how Aitenders can help before deciding.”

Step 2 – The Type of Project You Handle

If preparing a bid:

    “I handle small, frequent projects that need fast validation.” → UC1

    “I work on mid-size projects with multiple clauses and risks.” → UC2

    “I lead large, complex tenders with many contributors.” → UC3

    “I mainly need structured drafting support for my responses.” → UC7

If managing a project in execution:

    “I run small, straightforward projects that require quick answers.” → UC4

    “I manage mid-size projects with evolving commitments.” → UC5

    “I oversee large, multi-discipline projects with high risk.” → UC6

    “I need help drafting and justifying compliance during execution.” → UC8

If drafting & compliance from Step 1:

    “I draft responses for bids and need full coverage proof.” → UC7

    “I draft deliverables during execution and need traceability.” → UC8

Step 3 – Your Main Priority

    “I need to save time and reach decisions faster.” → UC1 / UC2

    “I need to guarantee compliance and avoid rejections.” → UC2 / UC3 / UC6 / UC8

    “I need to improve collaboration across multiple teams.” → UC3 / UC5 / UC6

    “I need to deliver documents that cover everything, with proof.” → UC7 / UC8

Step 4 – Who Will Use Aitenders Most

    “My offer management or bid team.” → UC1 / UC2 / UC3 / UC7

    “My contract or project managers.” → UC5 / UC6

    “My field or site operations team.” → UC4

    “My compliance or technical writers.” → UC7 / UC8

Step 5 – The Outcome You Expect

    “A validated bid analysis ready to present to management.” → UC1 / UC2

    “A complete compliance matrix with risks under control.” → UC3 / UC6

    “A live contract assistant accessible to my field teams.” → UC4 / UC5

    “Drafted deliverables with traceability and proof of coverage.” → UC7 / UC8

🔹 How It Works

    Each sentence card = a self-description of the user’s situation.

    After each step, options are narrowed.

    By Step 5, only one UC (UC1–UC8) matches.
