Instructions for Replit Agent: Pain Point Icons

    Objective:
    Replace all generic or placeholder icons in the "Manual Process Before" section with high-quality, professional icons that visually represent each specific pain point. The style must align with enterprise SaaS standards (clean, modern, and easy to understand at a glance).

    Guidelines:

        Use premium icon libraries such as Feather Icons, Heroicons, Font Awesome Pro, or Material Icons.

        All icons must be consistent in style (outlined or filled, depending on overall UI direction).

        Avoid custom SVG code—for maintainability and design consistency, use importable assets from trusted libraries.

    Icon Matching — One Per Pain Point:

        Excel compliance chaos across 8+ experts:
        → Use a clear Excel file or spreadsheet icon.

        Days lost extracting requirements from 500+ pages:
        → Use a document stack or timer/hourglass icon.

        Copy-paste errors risk million-euro exclusions:
        → Use a clipboard with error, warning triangle, or exclamation mark icon.

        Multiple review cycles delay submission:
        → Use a circular arrows, cycle, or clock with looping arrow icon.

        Hidden requirement gaps cause rejections:
        → Use a magnifying glass, exclamation inside a document, or gap/missing puzzle piece icon.

    Accessibility:
    Every icon must have an appropriate aria-label or descriptive alt text for accessibility.

    Sourcing:
    If the library does not cover a specific concept (e.g., "missing puzzle piece"), use the closest available professional icon and suggest alternatives if needed.

    Consistency:
    Icons should all have the same line width, sizing, and alignment. Each icon placed to the left of the corresponding pain point headline.

Example Instruction to Copy:

    “Replace all placeholder icons in the manual process section with professional icons from a trusted B2B library (Heroicons, Feather, Material, or Font Awesome Pro). Match each pain point to an icon that conveys its meaning:

        Excel/spreadsheet icon for compliance chaos,

        Document stack or hourglass for lost days,

        Clipboard error/exclamation for copy-paste errors,

        Circular arrows or clock for review cycles,

        Magnifying glass or missing puzzle piece for hidden gaps.

    Keep all icons consistent in style and size, positioned left of the headline, and fully accessible (aria labels/alt text). Do not use raw SVG code—use importable assets.”
