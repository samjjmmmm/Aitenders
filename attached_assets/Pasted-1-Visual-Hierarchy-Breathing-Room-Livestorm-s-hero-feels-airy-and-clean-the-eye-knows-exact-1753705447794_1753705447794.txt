1. Visual Hierarchy & Breathing Room

    Livestorm’s hero feels airy and clean; the eye knows exactly where to look, thanks to generous padding and clear zones.

    Your section is denser, with stacked content and modular UI but less visual breathing space.

Improvements:

    Add more whitespace around every content block—headline, feature card, and supporting information.

    Let elements “float” rather than feel boxed in, especially between the left (text) and right (UI visualization).

2. Content Focus & Simplicity

    Livestorm uses crisp, confidence-building headings, minimum explanatory text, and clear chunking of information.

    Your design leads with a technical description and several stacked stats, which dilutes focus.

Improvements:

    Shorten the subtext and break lengthy descriptions into two or three high-impact phrases or bullets.

    Remove or minimize dense stats or compliance progress bars in the hero; highlight only the most impressive metric or benefit upfront.

3. UI Visualization Quality

    Livestorm employs a convincing platform screenshot inside a device "frame," with realistic widgets, video feed, and chat—making the product’s utility tangible and aspirational.

    Your section shows a dashboard module, but it feels more abstract and less emotionally engaging.

Improvements:

    Replace or augment the dashboard card with a realistic, sharp UI screenshot showing the product in action—e.g., an RFP process, collaboration, or dashboard as a human would use it.

    Consider a browser or device frame around the visual to anchor it in real user context.

    Add subtle, relatable cues (e.g., avatar icons, active states) so visitors “see themselves” using it.

4. Call to Action & Trust Elements

    Livestorm places the CTA ("Start") where it’s instantly visible, using a strong color, and includes social proof directly beneath (like number of attendees or logos).

    Your section features a CTA ("Learn more") in a less dominant position and lacks supporting social cues.

Improvements:

    Move the primary CTA higher, make it visually dominant, and use brand accent color for the button.

    Add social proof just beneath the CTA—e.g., "Trusted by 2,000+ RFP teams," client logo carousel, or a compliance badge.

    Keep secondary CTAs subtle or below the fold.

5. Style Consistency & Modern Polish

    Livestorm maintains a restrained, modern color palette, extensive use of soft neutral backgrounds, and tightly harmonized icons and fonts.

    Your section uses strong accent colors, less subtlety in gradients and shadows, and more modular instead of seamless elements.

Improvements:

    Adopt a lighter, neutral background to help CTAs and visuals pop.

    Harmonize colors: use brand accent colors sparingly for CTAs and highlights, not as backgrounds or borders.

    Use modern, consistent iconography for each "feature" or role, and position icons before text, matching Livestorm’s clean visual grammar.

    Upgrade font sizes and weights for a visual scale hierarchy (large headline, medium subtext, small supplementary text).

6. Responsiveness and Accessibility

    Livestorm keeps layout and text perfectly readable on all devices; cards stack cleanly, and CTAs remain sticky or easy to find.

    Your section should stack text first, then the visual on mobile, ensuring CTAs do not get buried.

Improvements:

    Ensure all elements stack vertically on mobile, with priority given to headline and CTA.

    Maintain padding and alignment—nothing should feel crammed.
