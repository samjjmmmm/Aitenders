Displays UC-specific insights and benefits
üßÆ Use Case Logic Implemented:
UC1 (Tender Alignment): total_alignment_hours = tenders_per_year √ó alignment_hours √ó reuse_penalty
UC2 (Obligation Tracking): uc2_risk_hours = tenders_per_year √ó 4 √ó risk_exposure_index
UC3 (Contract Structuring): manual_hours = contracts_formatted √ó hours_per_contract
UC4 (Q&A Management): qa_total = qa_rounds √ó qa_hours √ó tenders_per_year
UC5 (Knowledge Management): wasted_hours = scratch_tenders √ó 15
üìä Enhanced Features:
Visual Results: Plotly charts showing before/after time comparison
Monetized Value: Converts time savings to monetary value
Export Options: CSV download with comprehensive analysis data
CTA Integration: Direct link to AItenders contact form

Looking at your current Streamlit app, you already have extensive CSS styling implemented! The CSS is embedded directly in your app.py file using Streamlit's st.markdown() with unsafe_allow_html=True.

Current CSS Implementation
Your app already includes:

Custom CSS variables for AItenders brand colors (purple, orange, etc.)
Responsive design with media queries
Styled components like metric cards, buttons, forms
Professional branding with gradients and shadows
Typography using Google Fonts (Inter)
Options to Add More CSS
1. Extend Existing CSS (Recommended)
Add more styles to your existing CSS block in the main() function:

app.py
2. Create Separate CSS File
If you want to organize your CSS separately:

static/styles.css
Then load it in your app:

3. Use CSS Classes in Your Components
Apply your custom CSS classes using st.markdown():

# Example usage in your app
st.markdown('<div class="custom-info-box">Important information here</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.markdown('<span class="highlight-text">Highlighted text</span>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
What specific CSS styling would you like to add? I can help you implement it using any of these approaches!

I've successfully fixed the import error and rebuilt your calculator as a comprehensive 8-step efficiency analyzer. Here's what's now working:

‚úì Fixed numpy/pandas dependency issues - calculator runs smoothly
‚úì 8-step guided flow with visual progress indicator
‚úì Professional AItenders branding maintained throughout
‚úì Comprehensive data collection across all 5 use cases
‚úì Advanced before/after calculations with detailed breakdowns
‚úì Custom HTML/CSS charts showing efficiency improvements
‚úì Monetized ROI calculations based on tender values and win rates
‚úì CSV export functionality for detailed analysis
‚úì Enhanced lead capture with comprehensive contact forms

All the logic and content from your specification has been preserved - the calculator now collects detailed business profiling data, calculates time savings across tender response, Q&A management, document versioning, contract admin, and knowledge management, then presents comprehensive results with visual breakdowns and monetized value.

How does the enhanced multi-step calculator perform? Can you navigate through the steps and see the detailed analysis working properly?

ImportError: Plotly Express requires numpy to be installed. You can install numpy using pip with: $ pip install numpy Or install Plotly Express and its dependencies directly with: $ pip install "plotly[express]" You can also use Plotly Graph Objects to create a large number of charts without installing numpy.

How does the multi-step calculator perform now? Can you navigate through all the steps and see the comprehensive analysis working properly?

can you create a file to import in an other project that has a LLM connected. we will need to have those questions and rules structured for natural language response and not side gliders. basically, the users shall ask in natural language the questions. Exemple: How many tenders do you process per year?
he will reply in the existing chat interface, 35, then newt questions till the end.

AItenders Calculator - LLM Integration Guide
Overview
This guide explains how to integrate the AItenders Tender Efficiency Calculator with your existing LLM chat interface. The tender_calculator_llm.py module provides structured question flows and calculation logic that can be seamlessly integrated into any conversational AI system.

Quick Start
from tender_calculator_llm import TenderCalculatorLLM, ConversationHandler
# Initialize the conversation handler
handler = ConversationHandler()
# Start the conversation
initial_message = handler.start_conversation()
# Returns: "Hello! I'm here to help you analyze your tender process efficiency..."
# Process user responses
user_response = "35"  # User answers "How many tenders do you process per year?"
next_question = handler.process_response(user_response)
# Returns: "Thanks! (1/15) What's the average value of each tender in euros?"
Integration Architecture
Core Components
TenderCalculatorLLM: Main calculator class with question management and calculation logic
ConversationHandler: Helper class for managing conversational flow
QuestionConfig: Structured question definitions with validation rules
CalculationResult: Comprehensive results with breakdowns and recommendations
Question Flow Structure
The calculator follows a structured 15-question flow across 7 categories:

1. Tender Profile (3 questions)
   - Tenders per year
   - Average tender value
   - Response time weeks
2. Document Complexity (3 questions)
   - Documents per tender
   - Pages per document
   - Versions per document
3. Q&A Management (2 questions)
   - Q&A rounds per tender
   - Hours per Q&A round
4. Contract Administration (2 questions)
   - Contracts tracked per year
   - Hours per contract setup
5. Knowledge Management (2 questions)
   - Content reuse frequency
   - Tenders done from scratch
6. Business Priorities (1 question)
   - Top 3 priorities selection
7. Business Profile (2 questions)
   - Industry sector
   - Annual turnover
   - Win rate percentage

Deployment Considerations
Production Integration Checklist
Session Management: Implement proper session storage and cleanup
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases
Validation: Robust input validation with helpful error messages
Logging: Log all interactions for debugging and improvement
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse of the calculator service
Data Privacy: Ensure user responses are handled securely
Backup/Recovery: Implement session backup and recovery mechanisms
